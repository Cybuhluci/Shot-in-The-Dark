# Shot In The Dark
Not a studio project. Not polished marketing copy. Just me making a stupidly fun, brutal singleplayer zombies game because I want to. If that sounds like your kind of nonsense, welcome.

### Quick pitch

Singleplayer, wave‑based zombies with guns that have stats as close to their real‑life counterpart as possible, old‑school Black Ops Zombies energy, and full‑on secret Easter Eggs.  
You play Agent 24, a dark operative for a utopian company called Shot In The Dark. Your job is to cleanse a planet by any means possible.

### Core things to know

Damage is ammo‑based (for example: 9mm weapons use a damage value of 20).  
Every map will have a hidden Easter Egg that ties into a larger story. If you want to discover them, good. If you just want to play, that’s cool too.

### Maps

Map 1: Der Riese stand‑in - the first map and current development priority.  
Future maps? Only if Map 1 goes well.

### Status

Prototype / early development.  
Core systems and the damage model are in design and early implementation.  
Der Riese stand‑in is the active priority for the first playable loop.

### Easter Eggs

Each major map will have an Easter Egg.  
EEs are secrets by design. If you want to play this game the way it was intended, don’t read the “EasterEgg” folder or open EE scripts in the repository. Spoilers are real folks - you have been warned.

### Controls & play notes
- Default controls: keyboard + mouse; WASD to move, mouse to look, F to interact with buttons.  
- Play focus: muck around, try and get to as high a round as possible (when roundbased is introduced)
- When reporting bugs: open an issue and include reproduction steps and a short video if possible.

### Wanna help actually build this with me?
Cool! I’ll actually respond if you reach out.  
Discord: `cybermuffin.` - I don't have a server; I'm not expecting this to explode in popularity.  
Unity: use Unity 6000 (this project uses the most recent version Unity 6000).  
Render pipeline: URP.

### License & attribution
Code and assets follow the repo license (if present). If there is no license yet, ask before using or redistributing major chunks. Placeholder assets are used from public-domain/free sources, mainly The Models Resource and other community packs.

### Contact / community

This isn’t a studio. Want to talk about balance, Easter Eggs, or something else? Open an issue, or message me on discord, my username is above, I'm not repeating it.

### Final note
Deliberately rough around the edges. Not aiming for corporate polish - aiming for something fun to build and brutally fun to play. If you like weird mechanics, secret EEs, and unapologetic old‑school zombies design, you’re in the right place.
